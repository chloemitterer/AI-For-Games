Spike Outcome Report

Number: 07
Spike Title: Emergent Group Behaviour
Personal: Chloe Mitterer 9725725

Goals:  
Goals/Deliverables: [CODE] + [SPIKE REPORT]
Create a group agent steering behaviour simulation that is able to demonstrate distinct
modes of emergent group behaviour. In particular, the simulation must:
• Include cohesion, separation and alignment steering behaviours
• Include basic wandering behaviours
• Use weighted-sum to combine all steering behaviours
• Support the adjustment of parameters for each steering force while running

Technologies, Tools, and Resources used:
Sublime Text 3
Lecture on Autonomously Moving Agents
Files from lab 06

Tasks undertaken: 
* Read lecture on Autonomously Moving Agents
* Read goals for Spike
* Make certain you are familiar with the files from lab 06
* Add new key presses that will control cohesion, separation, wander and alignment
* Add a dictionary that will control the levels for cohesion, seperation, wander and alignment (set initially to 100)
* Using code from the lecture, create new functions in agent for cohesion, separation and alignment
* In main create a function that will draw on the screen the current levels of cohesion, separation, wander and alignment
* Back in agent create a function called emergent that uses all four of cohesion, seperation, wander and alignment to designate force, using the code from the lecture.
* Limit force either with a max_force value in init or using truncate in emergent.
*test to make sure everything is working, fix compiling errors
*test different value combinations for cohesion, separation, alignment and wander to make certain each is working (test each individually with the others set at 0).

What we found out:
* How to sum together steering behaviours
* How to truncate
* How to program cohesion, seperation and alignment as force modifiers

Recommendations [Optional]:
* Wander had to be divided by 100 because its force was too strong
* Has increased confidence and knowledge of the team
