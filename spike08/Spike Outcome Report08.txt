Spike Outcome Report
-------------------- 
Number: 08
Spike Title: Emergent Group Behaviour
Personal: Chloe Mitterer 9725725

Goals:  
Create a hunter-prey agent simulation for two or more agents, in which "prey" agents avoid
"hunter" agents by concealing themselves behind objects in the environment. The simulation must:
• Include several "objects" that prey can hide behind (simple circles).
• Show a distinction between the "hunter" and "prey" agent appearance and abilities.
• Show an indicator ("x" or similar) to indicate suitable "hide" locations for prey to select from
• Prey agents must select a “good” location, and head to it, based on tactical evaluation.
Note: leave instructions on how to use your code (keys to use) with your code / report.

KEYS: Press A to add more hiding agents

Technologies, Tools, and Resources used:
Sublime Text 3
Lecture on Autonomously Moving Agents
Files from Spike 07

Tasks undertaken: 
* Read lecture on Autonomously Moving Agents
* Read goals for Spike
* Make certain you are familiar with the files from lab 07
* Remove unnecessary functions and other code from the files (things that do not directly relate to behaviours necessary such as wandering and arriving)
* Create a class for the objects that will be used to hide behind
* The object must initialise and must have a render function
* Create several of the objects in the main function
* Initialise a hunter in world.py with different attributes to the normal agents. The hunter should be set to wander
* Make a function that determines the hiding spots for a hunter in a particular frame, this function can be in world.py
* The function should use normalise to determine this
* Create another function that determines the "best" hiding spot by determining which of the hiding spots is furthest away from the hunter.
* Now create a hide function in agent, which will be what the agent is doing
* Determine where the best hiding spot is and have the agent arrive at the hiding spot
* If there is no best hiding spot, set the agent to flee
* Test!

What we found out:
* How to use normalise
* How to make an agent hide from another agent

Recommendations [Optional]:
* Work on multiple hunters later
* Has increased confidence and knowledge for the team
